# 1. I see the unswer is a innumber, the smallest number i have seen is 5,the largest is 20
# 2.I see the unswer is a number on line 2, the smallest number is 3, the lagest is 9,
# the line 2 couldn't produced a 4 because the step size is 2,and 4 is not in the specified range
# 3. the code prints a random floating-point number between 2.5 and 5.5, The smallest number that could be seen is 2.5, and the largest is 5.5.
