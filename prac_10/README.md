## Estimates Accuracy
Throughout the practical tasks, my initial estimates varied in accuracy, but as the subject progressed, I became more adept at judging the time and effort required for each task. This improvement came from a deeper understanding of my own working pace and the complexities of the tasks at hand. Estimating helped me in planning and allocating time more effectively, which is a skill that extends beyond the academic environment.

## Learning from Code Reviews
Participating in code reviews was highly beneficial for my growth as a developer. Being reviewed taught me to consider different perspectives and to be open to feedback, which often led to improvements in my code that I hadn't considered. Conducting reviews, on the other hand, sharpened my ability to critically evaluate code, articulate constructive feedback, and appreciate diverse coding styles and solutions.

## Changes to Practical Tasks
If I were responsible for the subject, I would incorporate more real-world examples to link theory with practice more closely. I would also encourage pair programming to enhance collaborative skills and knowledge sharing. Finally, I would introduce a step-by-step approach to complex problems, to help students learn how to break down and tackle large coding tasks in manageable segments.
